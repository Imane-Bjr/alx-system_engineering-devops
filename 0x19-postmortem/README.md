- **Impact**: 100% of users encountered a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to access the site.
- **Root Cause**: A missing WordPress configuration file (`wp-config.php`) caused PHP errors, leading Apache to fail.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM UTC**: Users reported the site was down. Initial complaints started pouring in.
- **10:05 AM UTC**: Monitoring systems alerted the team to high error rates on Apache.
- **10:10 AM UTC**: Investigation began; Apache was found to be returning a 500 error.
- **10:20 AM UTC**: Strace was used to diagnose the problem, revealing issues with missing configuration files.
- **10:45 AM UTC**: Investigation initially focused on server resources and PHP settings, which were not the root cause.
- **11:00 AM UTC**: DevOps team was involved and identified the missing WordPress configuration file as the issue.
- **11:15 AM UTC**: The missing file was restored from backup, and Apache was restarted.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The `wp-config.php` file was missing, which caused PHP errors and led to Apache returning a 500 error.
- **Resolution**: Restored the missing file from backup and restarted Apache, resolving the issue.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will:

1. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement alerts for missing critical files to catch issues before they impact users.
